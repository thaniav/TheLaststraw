  ProductModel("Airpods",15995,0,19995,"Asset/shoppingImages/Air pods.jpeg","""AirPods are Apple's completely wire-free headphones, which look a bit like the Apple EarPods from older devices, but without the cables. AirPods have Apple-designed tech inside like a special wireless chip called the W1 or H1 (depending on version), an accelerometer for gestures, dual optical sensors, dual beamforming microphones for Siri and phone calls, and a second accelerometer for speech detection. 
AirPods come with the AirPods Charging Case, which is used for both charging and storage purposes so the AirPods don't get lost. The Charging Case is about the size of a container of dental floss, so it's easily pocketable. A Lightning port at the bottom lets the AirPods and the case be charged with the Lightning cables you already have on hand, and the Wireless Charging Case lets you charge with a Qi wireless charger.
